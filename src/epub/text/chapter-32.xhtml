			<p>For a second Legge was paralysed with rage and fear. Then, in the wildness of his despair, he kicked at the man, who had slipped from the bed and was holding him. He heard an exclamation, felt for a second the fingers relax; and, slipping like an eel from the grasp, flew to the door and closed it. He stood, breathless and panting by the doorway, until he heard the sound of steel against the inner keyhole, and in a flash realised that Johnny had secured the passkey. Quick as lightning, he slipped his own key back into the lock and turned it slightly, so that it could not be pushed out from the other side.</p>
			<p>Johnny Gray! How had he got there? He fled up the stairs and hammered on the door of the cell where he thought his prisoner was held safe. A surly voice replied to him.</p>
			<p>“You swine!” he howled. “You let him go! You twister! You can stay there and starve, damn you!”</p>
			<p>“I didn’t let him go. He held me up. Look out, Jeff, he’s got a gun.”</p>
			<p>The news staggered the man. The search of Johnny’s clothing had been of a perfunctory nature, but he had thought that it was impossible that any kind of weapon could have been concealed.</p>
			<p>“Let me out, guv’nor,” pleaded the prisoner. “You’ve got a key.”</p>
			<p>There was a third key in his house, Jeffrey remembered. Perhaps this man might be of use to him. He was still weak from his wound, and would need assistance.</p>
			<p>“All right, I’ll get the key. But if you shopped me⁠—”</p>
			<p>“I didn’t shop you, I tell you. He held me up⁠—”</p>
			<p>Legge went back to his room, found the key, and, taking another stiff dose of whisky, returned and released his man.</p>
			<p>“He’s got my gun, too,” explained Bill. “Where are all the fellows? We’ll soon settle with him.”</p>
			<p>“They’ve gone,” said Jeffrey.</p>
			<p>What a fool he had been! If he had had the sense to keep the gang together only for a few hours⁠—But he was safe, unless Johnny found a means of getting through the window.</p>
			<p>“In my room you’ll find a pistol; it is in the top right-hand corner of my desk,” he said quickly. “Take it and get outside Johnny’s cell⁠—on the yard side. If he tries to escape that way, shoot. Because, if he escapes, you’re going a long journey, my friend.”</p>
			<p>Inside the cell, a chagrined Johnny Gray sat down on the girl’s bed to consider the possibilities of the position.</p>
			<p>“My dear, there’s going to be serious trouble here, and I don’t want you to think otherwise,” he said. “I should imagine there were quite a number of men in this prison, in which case, though I shall probably get two or three of them, they’ll certainly get me in the end.”</p>
			<p>She sat by his side, holding his hand, and the pressure of her fingers was eloquent of the faith she had in him.</p>
			<p>“Johnny, dear, does it matter very much what happens now? They can’t come in, and we can’t get out. How long will it take to starve us to death?”</p>
			<p>Johnny had already considered that problem.</p>
			<p>“About three days,” he said, in such a matter-of-fact tone that she laughed. “My only hope, Marney, is that your father, who, as I told you, has escaped, may know more about this place than he has admitted.”</p>
			<p>“Did you know anything about it?” she asked.</p>
			<p>He hesitated.</p>
			<p>“Yes, I think I did. I wasn’t sure, though I was a fool not to locate it just as soon as Fenner warned me against Keytown Jail. These chaps like to speak in parables, and mystery is as the breath of their nostrils. Besides, I should have been certain that Fenner knew the jail had been taken over from the Government.”</p>
			<p>He made a careful examination of the bars about the window, but without instruments or tools to force them, he knew that escape that way was impossible. When, in the early hours of the morning, he saw the patient figure of Bill, he realised the extent of the impossibility.</p>
			<p>“Good morning, William. I see you’re out,” he greeted the scowling sentry, who immediately jumped to cover, flourishing his long-barrelled weapon.</p>
			<p>“Don’t you show your nose, or I’ll blow it off,” he threatened. “We’ve got you, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gray.”</p>
			<p>“They’ve got you, alas, my poor William,” said Johnny sadly. “The busies will be here at nine o’clock⁠—you don’t suppose that I should have let myself come into a trap like this? Of course, I didn’t. I squeaked! It was my only chance, William. And your only chance is to sneak away at the earliest opportunity, and turn State’s evidence. I’m addressing you as a friend.”</p>
			<p>“You’ll never get away from here alive,” said the man. “Jeff’s going to fix you.”</p>
			<p>“Indeed?” the prisoner began politely, when a scream made him turn.</p>
			<p>“Johnny!”</p>
			<p>The shutter which hid the grille in the door was swung back, and the muzzle of Jeffrey’s Browning had been pushed through one of the openings. As Johnny dropped flat on the bed, he was stunned by the deafening sound of an explosion. Something hit the wall, ricochetted to the roof, and fell almost at the girl’s feet. Before the pistol could be withdrawn, Johnny Gray had fired. A jagged end of iron showed where his bullet struck.</p>
			<p>“The time for persiflage,” said Johnny cheerfully, “is past. Now you will sit in that corner, young lady, and will not budge without permission.” He pointed to the wall nearest the door, which afforded perfect cover, and, dragging up a stool, he seated himself by her side. “Jeffrey’s got quite a tough proposition,” he said in his conversational tone. “He can’t burn the prison, because there’s nothing to burn. He can’t come in, and he mustn’t go out. If he would only for one moment take away that infernal key⁠—”</p>
			<p>“There is another door going out from the bathroom,” she said suddenly. “I think it leads to an exercise ground. You can just see a little railed-off space through the window.”</p>
			<p>Johnny went into the bathroom and examined the door. Screwing his head, he could see, through a broken pane, ten square yards of space, where in olden times a condemned prisoner took his exercise, removed from the gaze of his fellows. He tried the key, and to his delight, it turned. Another minute and he was in the little paved yard.</p>
			<p>Looking round, he saw a high and narrow gateway, which seemed to be the only exit from the courtyard. And on the other side of that gateway was William, the sentry, well armed and sufficiently terrified to be dangerous. Slipping off his boots, Johnny crept to the gate and listened. The sound of the man’s footsteps pacing the flagged walk came to him. Stooping, he squinted through the keyhole, and saw Bill standing, his back toward him, some six yards away. There was no time to be lost. He inserted the key, and the gate was opened before the man could turn to face the levelled revolver.</p>
			<p>“Don’t shout,” whispered Johnny. “You’re either discreet or dead. Hand over that gun, you unfortunate man.” He moved swiftly toward the terrified criminal, and relieved him of his weapon.</p>
			<p>With a gesture, Johnny directed him to the exercise yard.</p>
			<p>“Get in and stay,” he said, and locked the door, and for the second time, Bill (his other name, Johnny never discovered, was Holliss) was a prisoner.</p>
			<p>Skirting the building, he came to the entrance of the hall. The door was open, and with his hand on the uplifted hammer of the gun, and his finger pressing the trigger, Johnny leapt into the building.</p>
			<p>“Hands up!” he shouted.</p>
			<p>At the words, Jeffrey Legge spun round. There was a boom of sound, something whistled past Gray’s face, and he fired twice. But now the man was running, zigzagging to left and right, and Johnny hesitated to fire. He disappeared through the door at the farther end of the hall, shutting it behind him, and Johnny raced after him.</p>
			<p>He was in the courtyard now, facing the grille-covered archway. As he came into view, Jeffrey disappeared through the lodge-keeper’s door. Johnny tried the grille, but in vain, for a passkey operates on all locks save the lock of the entrance gate of a prison. That alone is distinct, and may not be opened save by the key that was cut for it.</p>
			<p>Covering the lodge-keeper’s door with his gun, Johnny waited, and, waiting, heard a rumbling sound. Something was coming down the centre of the archway. The straight line of it came lower and lower. A hanging gate! He had forgotten that most old country prisons were so equipped. Under the cover of this ancient portcullis, Legge could escape, for it masked the entrance of the lodge.</p>
			<p>He turned back to the girl.</p>
			<p>“Keep out of sight. He’s got away,” he warned her. “This fellow isn’t finished yet.”</p>
			<p>The gate was down⁠ ⁠… Jeffrey put on the overcoat he had left in the lodge, slipped his pistol into his pocket and opened the great gates. He had at least a dozen hours’ start, he thought, as he stepped into the open⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>“Please do not put your hand in your pocket, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeffrey,” said a plaintive voice. “I should <em>so</em> hate to shoot a fellow-creature. It would be a deed utterly repugnant to my finest feelings.”</p>
			<p>Jeffrey raised his hands to their fullest extent, for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Reeder was not alone. Behind him were four armed policemen, a cordon of mounted constabulary, spread in a semicircle, cutting off all avenues of escape. And, most ominous of all, was the deadly scrutiny of Peter Kane, who stood at Reeder’s right hand.</p>
